# Task

Task is a Todo application which allows the user to add, delete, edit and retrieve the items from their list. In this application, I attempt to use Spring Boot (Kotlin) with GraphQL as the backend RestAPI. On the front-end, I use Angular for the UI aspect of the application. 

## Tools Used
- Intellij Idea (with [Spring Initialzr](https://start.spring.io/) extension)
- Visual Studio code
- MongoDB


## Usage

To run the app on the back-end use
```'
mvn spring-boot:run
```
To run the application on the front-end, use the following command:
```'
ng serve --open
```
NOTE: The flag, --open, is optional but the command open the app in the users' default browser
